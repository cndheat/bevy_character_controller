# bevy_character_controller
A basic character controller for Bevy that uses Rapier3d's move_shape function

## Current State
- Directional movement works fairly well, but the collider still gets "stuck" on walls it tries to slide against, needs to be fixed
- Some code or math might be incorrect, feel free to submit a PR if you want to fix or add something
